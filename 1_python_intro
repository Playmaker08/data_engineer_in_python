a) Create a list of authors who have published less than 25 books.

# Create an empty list
authors_below_twenty_five = []

# Loop through the authors dictionary
for key, value in authors.items():
  
  # Check for values less than 25
  if value < 25:
    
    # Append the author to the list
    authors_below_twenty_five.append(key)
    
print(authors_below_twenty_five)
// Output:    ['Nicholas Sparks', 'Judith Krantz', 'Harold Robbins', 'J. K. Rowling', 'Sidney Sheldon']

b) Identify the genre with the highest and lowest average sales revenue.

for genre, average_sale in genre_sales.items():
    
    # Filter for the maximum sales value
    if average_sale == 5166000000:
      
        # Print the most popular genre
        print("Most popular genre: ", genre)
        print("Average sales: ", average_sale)
    
    # Filter for the minimum sales value
    elif average_sale == 80000000:
      
        # Print the least popular genre
        print("Least popular genre: ", genre)
        print("Average sales: ", average_sale)
// Output:     Least popular genre:  Literature
    Average sales:  80000000
    Most popular genre:  Manga
    Average sales:  5166000000

c) Loop through genre_sales dictionary and print the sales of books in the Horror or Mystery genres.

# Loop through the dictionary
for genre, sale in genre_sales.items():
  
  # Check if genre is Horror or Mystery
  if genre == "Horror" or genre == "Mystery":
    print(genre, sale)

# Loop through the dictionary
for genre, sale in genre_sales.items():
  
  # Check if genre is Horror or Mystery
  if genre == "Horror" or genre == "Mystery":
    print(genre, sale)
    
  # Check if genre is Thriller and sale is at least 3 million
  elif genre == "Thriller" and sale >= 3000000:
    print(genre, sale)
    // Output:
    Horror 312500000
    Mystery 300000000
    Thriller 320000000
